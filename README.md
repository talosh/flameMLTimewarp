## Installation

### Single workstation / Easy install

* Download latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/talosh/flameTimewarpML/releases) page
* All you need to do is put the .py file in /opt/Autodesk/shared/python and launch/relaunch flame. The first time it will unpack/install what it needs. It will give you a prompt to let you know when itâ€™s finished.
* It is possible to choose the installation folder. Default installation folders are:

```bash
~/Documents/flameTimewarpML                             # Mac
~/flameTimewarpML                                       # Linux
```

### Preferences location

* In case you'd need to reset preferences

```bash
~/Library/Preferences/flameTimewarpML                   # Mac
~/.config/flameTimewarpML                               # Linux
```

### Configuration via env variables

* There are an option to set working folder over env variable  
Setting FLAMETWML_DEFAULT_WORK_FOLDER will set default folder and user will still be allowed to change it

```bash
export FLAMETWML_DEFAULT_WORK_FOLDER=/Volumes/projects/my_timewarps/
```

* Setting FLAMETWML_WORK_FOLDER will block user from changing it. This read every time just before the tool is launched so one can use it with other pipeline tools to change it dynamically depending on context

```bash
export FLAMETWML_WORK_FOLDER=/Volumes/projects/my_timewarps/
```

* Setting FLAMETWML_HARDCOMMIT will lead to imported clip hard commited after import and all temporary files deleted

```bash
export FLAMETWML_HARDCOMMIT=True
```
### Updating / Downgrading PyTorch to match CUDA version

This example will change Pytorch to cuda11

* Get pytorch build for python 3.8 and cuda11:
```
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu110/torch-1.7.1%2Bcu110-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
```
* Init miniconda3 environment:
```
~/flameTimewarpML/bundle/init_env
```
* In new terminal window that opens check current pytorch cuda version:
```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"
```
this should report 10.2
* Update pytorch
```
pip3 install --upgrade ~/Downloads/torch-1.7.1+cu110-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
```
* Check pytorch cuda version again:
```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"
```
this now should report 11.0


### Centralised / Manual Install

* It is possible to do easy install on one of the workstations to common location and then configure other via env variables (see Centralised configuration section)
* flameTimewarpML is made of three components.
    1. Miniconda3 isolated Python 3.8 environment with some additional dependence libraries (see requirements.txt)
    2. A set of python scripts that are called from command line and should be running within Python 3.8 environment. Those two parts are not dependant on Flame and can be run as a standalone tools.
    3. Flame script to be run inside Flame. It has to know the location of two previous parts to be able to initialize Python 3.8 environment and then run command line tools to process image sequences.
* Get the source from [Releases](https://github.com/talosh/flameTimewarpML/releases) page or directly from repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talosh/flameTimewarpML.git
```

* It is possible to share Python3 code location between platforms, but Miniconda3 python environment should be placed separately for Mac and Linux.
This example will use:

```bash
Python3 code location:
/Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML                       # Mac 
/mnt/software/flameTimewarpML                           # Linux

miniconda3 location:
/Volumes/software/miniconda3                            # Mac
/mnt/software/miniconda3                                # Linux
```

* Do not place those folders inside Flame's python hooks folder.
The only file that should be placed in Flame hooks folder is flameTimewarpML.py

* Create folders

```bash
mkdir -p /Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML                       # Mac
mkdir -p /Volumes/software/miniconda3                            # Mac

mkdir -p /mnt/software/flameTimewarpML                           # Linux
mkdir -p /mnt/software/miniconda3                                # Linux
```

* Copy the contents of 'bundle' folder to the code location.

```bash
cp -a bundle/* /Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML/       # Mac
cp -a bundle/* /mnt/software/flameTimewarpML/           # Linux
```

* Download Miniconda3 for Python 3.8 from <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>  
Shell installer is used for this example.

* Install Miniconda3 to centralized location:

```bash
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -bu -p /Volumes/software/miniconda3/  # Mac
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -bu -p /mnt/software/miniconda3/       # Linux
```

* In case you'd like to move Miniconda3 installation later you'll have to re-install it again.
Please refer to Anaconda docs: <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/move-directory/>

* Init installed Miniconda3 environment:

```bash
/Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML/init_env  /Volumes/software/miniconda3/   # Mac
/mnt/software/flameTimewarpML/init_env  /mnt/software/miniconda3/           # Linux
```

The script will open new konsole window.

* In case you do it over ssh remotely on Linux edit the line at the very end of init_env

```bash
cmd_prefix = 'konsole -e /bin/bash --rcfile ' + tmp_bash_rc_file
```

```bash
cmd_prefix = '/bin/bash --rcfile ' + tmp_bash_rc_file
```

* To check if environment is properly initialized: there should be (base) before shell prompt. python --version should give Python 3.8.5 or greater

* From this shell prompt install dependency libraries:

```bash
pip3 install -r /Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML/requirements.txt          # Mac
pip3 install -r /mnt/software/flameTimewarpML/requirements.txt              # Linux
```

* It is possible to download the packages and install it without internet connection. Install Miniconda3 on the machine that is connected to internet and download dependency packages:

```bash
pip3 download -r bundle/requirements.txt -d packages_folder
```

then it is possible to install packages from folder:

```bash
pip3 install -r /Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML/requirements.txt --no-index --find-links /Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML/packages_folder
```

* Copy flameTimewarpML.py to your Flame python scripts folder

* set FLAMETWML_BUNDLE, FLAMETWML_MINICONDA environment variables to point code and miniconda locations.

```bash
export FLAMETWML_BUNDLE=/Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML/          # Mac
export FLAMETWML_MINICONDA=//Volumes/software/miniconda3/           # Mac

export FLAMETWML_BUNDLE=/mnt/software/flameTimewarpML/              # Linux
export FLAMETWML_MINICONDA=/mnt/software/miniconda3/                # Linux
```

More granular settings per platform possible with

```bash
export FLAMETWML_BUNDLE_MAC=/Volumes/software/flameTimewarpML/
export FLAMETWML_BUNDLE_LINUX=/mnt/software/flameTimewarpML/
export FLAMETWML_MINICONDA_MAC=/Volumes/software/miniconda3/
export FLAMETWML_MINICONDA_LINUX=mnt/software/miniconda3/
```
